# List of commands:
Absolutely! Here’s a **cleaner, clearer rewrite** of your Git command definitions, ordered logically based on a typical Git workflow. After the list, I’ll suggest a few other useful commands and concepts you might consider adding.

## Git Workflow Commands & Definitions

### 1. **git status**

* **Shows the current state of the working directory and the staging area, letting you see which changes are staged, unstaged, or untracked.**

### 2. **git add**

* **Moves changes from the working directory to the staging area, preparing them to be committed.**

### 3. **git diff**

* **Displays the differences between files in the working directory and the staging area (unstaged changes).**

### 4. **git diff HEAD**

* **Shows the differences between the working directory and the latest commit (HEAD), including staged and unstaged changes.**

### 5. **git commit**

* **Records the staged changes as a snapshot in the local repository, along with a descriptive message.**

### 6. **git log**

* **Lists the commit history of the current branch with detailed information.**

### 7. **git branch**

* **Lists all local branches in the repository.**

### 8. **git checkout**

* **Switches to another branch or restores files. (Also used to create new branches in older versions; use `git switch` or `git restore` in newer versions.)**

### 9. **git merge**

* **Combines changes from a specified branch into the current branch.**

### 10. **git rebase**

* **Reapplies commits from one branch onto another, creating a linear history.**

### 11. **git cherry-pick**

* **Applies a specific commit from another branch onto the current branch.**

### 12. **git stash**

* **Temporarily saves uncommitted changes in the working directory to be reapplied later.**

### 13. **git reset**

* **Unstages changes from the staging area or moves the current branch to a specified commit, optionally modifying the working directory.**

### 14. **git revert**

* **Creates a new commit that undoes the changes from a specified previous commit.**

### 15. **git fetch**

* **Downloads new commits and data from a remote repository but does not integrate them into your local branches.**

### 16. **git pull**

* **Fetches new commits from a remote repository and immediately merges them into the current branch.**

### 17. **git push**

* **Uploads commits from your local repository to a remote repository.**

### 18. **git clone**
* **Copies an entire remote repository to your local machine.**

### 19. **git remote**
*  **Lists, adds, or removes remote repository connections.**

### 20. **git switch**
*  **A newer command to switch branches (alternative to `git checkout`).**

### 21. **.gitignore**
*  **A file specifying intentionally untracked files to ignore.**

### 22. **git restore**
*  **Restores working directory files to their state at a previous commit or stage (alternative to parts of `git checkout`).**

### 23. **git tag**
*  **Creates, lists, or deletes tags (named points in history often used for releases).**

### 24. **.gitignore**
*  **A file specifying intentionally untracked files to ignore.**

## Key Concepts

* **Working directory:**
  The folder where you make changes to your project files.

* **Staging area:**
  An intermediate area where you place changes you want to include in the next commit.

* **Local repository:**
  The complete versioned history of your project stored on your computer.

* **Remote repository:**
  A version of your project hosted on a server, like GitHub or GitLab.
