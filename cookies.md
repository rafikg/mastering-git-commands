# cookies recipe
## Ingredients
1 cup (226g) unsalted butter, softened

1 cup (200g) granulated sugar

1 cup (220g) packed brown sugar

2 large eggs

2 tsp vanilla extract

3 cups (375g) all-purpose flour

1 tsp baking soda

½ tsp baking powder

5 tsp salt

2 cups (340g) semi-sweet chocolate chips
## Instructions
Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

Cream the butter and sugars:
In a large bowl, beat the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy (about 2–3 minutes).

Add eggs and vanilla:
Beat in the eggs, one at a time. Stir in vanilla extract.

Mix dry ingredients:
In a separate bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.

Combine wet and dry:
Gradually mix the dry ingredients into the butter mixture until just combined. Do not overmix.

Add chocolate chips:
Stir in chocolate chips with a spatula or spoon.

Scoop and place:
Drop dough by rounded tablespoons (or use a cookie scoop) onto the baking sheet, spaced about 2 inches apart.

Bake:
Bake for 10–12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and centers are set but soft.

Cool:
Let cookies cool on the baking sheet for 2 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
